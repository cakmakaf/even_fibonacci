# Even Fibonacci

We gave a solution from one of the problems of Project Euler.

## Project Description

In this repo, we gave a solution of the second problems of Project Euler. The porblem is:

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

In the "project_euler_even_fibonacci.ipynb" you will see our solution for the problem, and you can contribute your own as weel. 

## Execution

To execute the program, you need to have Python 3.x and an editor. If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.X installer and not the Python 2.7 installer.
